# ASAP CRN Cloud Releases

This repository contains release information for ASAP CRN datasets and collections.

## Structure
- 'releases.doi': all versions reference 
- `releases.json`: JSON index containing all releases with associated datasets and collections
- `releases/<release_version>/`: Individual release directories
  - version: current version of the dataset
  - `release.json`: Collection metadata including title, description, DOI, version, and list of datasets and collections
  - 'release.doi': current release reference 
  - 'scripts/' sub directory which contains any scripts related to the most current release



- Release tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) correspond to published versions

in the 'releases/' directory, there are subdirectories for each release. Each release has a 'release.json' file that contains the release metadata.

Currently there are 9 releases: v1.0.0, v2.0.0, v2.0.1, v2.0.2, v2.0.3, v3.0.0, v3.0.1, v3.0.2, and v4.0.0
